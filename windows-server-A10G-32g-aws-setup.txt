# Create an AWS G5.xlarge/G5.2xlarge Windows Server instance with a minumum 60G disk space then log into it
# Note that this option has a 24Gb GPU and 16Gb of RAM (although I actually used the G5.2xlarge 32Gb RAM version)
# These instances also have extra drive space but we're not going to use it (you can't boot off of it)
# Cost 1.19 usd / hour + 3.00 usd / month disk (2xlarge = 1.58 usd / hour)
